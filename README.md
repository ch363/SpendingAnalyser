# Spending Analyser (scaffold)

This repository is a scaffold for a Streamlit-based spending analysis app.

Structure: The project contains packages for the Streamlit UI (`app/`), core business logic (`core/`), analytics, visualization, configuration, and tests.

This README intentionally contains no implementation details â€” it's a scaffold only.

## Quick start

To explore the Trading212-inspired dashboard scaffold locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app/main.py
```

The layout renders demo data so you can iterate on the UI before connecting the backend services.
